# Debian Buster ships msmtp 1.8.3, which still doesn't have OAuth2
# support, needed by GMail.  Trying the package from Debian sid 1.8.8,
# which contains OAuth2 support, didn't work either because
# `passwordeval` was raising "Permission denied" even after running
# the proper `chmod` command to the `oauth2token` script. That's why I
# ended up compiling msmtp from source control and it ended up working
# (although compilation did raise errors on the processing of
# gettext).
